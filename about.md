I'm a Husband, Software engineer, Surfer and Jesus freak from the Northern Beaches Sydney.

After my morning surf I spend most of my days working with the awesome team at [Found Careers](http://www.found.careers/). A have a beautiful wife and an ugly dog.

I want to use my coding skills to help people. I love learning new programming technologies and building products and I especially want to build things that will further the kingdom.

I'm always looking to meet like-minded people so get in touch on twitter or linkedin.
